# Cross-chain-Lit-Protocol-signature-verification

## Write a smart contract to perform Lit Protocol signature verification on any chain that supports a pre-compile for BLS12-381 (EIP-2537)

There are a handful of blockchains that already support a pre-compile for BLS12-381, like Celo. For this bounty, pick a popular blockchain that supports this pre-compile and write the smart contract to verify the network signature created by Lit Protocol. This will enable developers on chains to verify data about token holdings across blockchains.
